            <p>
                The history of Basotho blankets can be traced back to the 19th century when European traders introduced woolen blankets to the people of Lesotho.
                The blankets were highly valued for their warmth and durability, and they quickly became popular among the Basotho people.
                The blankets were originally gifted to the then ruler <span class="highlight">King Moshoeshoe I</span> by a British man known only as "Mr Howell" in the late 19th century.
